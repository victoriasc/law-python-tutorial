## Running Python

### Where can I run python 
We are going to be using an online version of jupyter notebooks.
This allows you to both run python code in segments and to use markdown to notate what you learn.

You can find the link here:
[Jupyter notebooks][jupyter-nb]

### Using Jupyter notebook

1. Open a new notebook

2. Practice making Code and Markdown sections

3. Practice running code 
Type the basic equation you see above and press Cmd + Enter (or the little triangle at the top)
This allows you to run the code

For the remainder of this session anything you see in a code block - run it within a code section on your jupyter notebook
{% highlight python %}
# This is a code block
print("Hello, World")
{% endhighlight %}
